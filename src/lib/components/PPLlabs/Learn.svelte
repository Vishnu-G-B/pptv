            Q: What is investing?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-white text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
            A: Investing is the process of buying assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or real estate, with
            the
            expectation that they will increase in value over time. The
            goal is to generate income from dividends or interest, or to sell the assets at a profit.

            should I invest?</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
            A: Investing can help you build wealth and achieve long-term financial goals, such as retirement or
            paying
            for a child's education. It also provides a way to grow
            your savings faster than traditional bank accounts, which may offer lower interest rates.

            are
            the risks of investing?</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
            A: All investments carry some level of risk, including the potential to lose money. Factors such as
            market
            volatility, economic conditions, and company performance
            can affect investment returns. However, higher-risk investments may offer the potential for greater
            rewards
            over time.

            do I
            get started with investing?</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
            A: To begin investing, you'll need to open a brokerage account or other investment vehicle. Research
            different types of investments and consider your financial goals,
            risk tolerance, and time horizon. You may also want to consult with a financial advisor for personalized
            guidance.
